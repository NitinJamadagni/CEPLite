=======

A light weight CEP(Complex Event Processing) Engine for End-Devices.It is particularly suited for IoT applications which
involve processing of continous income of events and pushing it to the cloud/servers.
The basic logic behind this project is that instead of performing all kinds of ComplexEventProcessing on the cloud,we could 
add a distributed nature to the processing that takes place and perform part/pre processing of the events on the end-devices(like android phones/sensors having Tiny OSs) and then pushing the complex processing to the cloud.
Will be releasing a implementation for android soon.

To be done/further work in progress:1)Adding joins over Streams to the engine.(Suggestions welcome!)
                                    2)Extending support for android.

                for any queries/suggestions/errors found.Will release a detailed documentation
                the architecture of the engine soon.Until then please contact the given email-id for queries.
